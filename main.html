                <p>
                    WELCOME! My name is Kalyn Mitchell and I am a current student at Boise State University pursuing a
                    Bachelor's in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies. I have spent my time at University
                    cultivating
                    a variety of skills, including gaining experience in website development, application development,
                    and
                    UX/UI. These skills can be seen in a multitude of my projects throughout my portfolio.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I have ventured down this path, I have developed a love for helping those in need of my services.
                    I have created applications aimed to help the greater good, and strive to continue to do so
                    throughout my professional carreer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My want to help others can be seen throughout many of my projects. My most recent project completed
                    was a prototype of an application aimed to help the students at Boise State University find
                    available parking. One of my current projects is a virtual reality game that helps dog owners,
                    specifically owners of reactive dogs, learn how to properly read their body language and gain
                    confidence in their training.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With a passion for web development and UX design, I aim to
                    create innovative and positive digital
                    experiences.

                            <b>Overview:</b> At the start of my web development journey, I had the
                            privledge working with a local martial arts school. This project
                            was more than simply developing a website, but capturing the
                            company's spirit and transforming it onto a digital space. Completing
                            this project gave me first hand experience with real world clients and
                            gave me the knowledge of how to interact in a professional manner,
                            utilize client feedback, and further strengthened my development skills
                            learned while in University.

                            their parent company, Soul Self Defense approached me asking to help redesign
                            the Soul Self Defense Website. The development of this website helped me
                            further my skills interacting with clients. With this project I was able to hone my skills,
                            embrace in client collaboration, and create a digital environment that complimented
                            their sister site!

                            <b>Overview:</b> This website was developed for a local dog training company. Our goal
                            was to bring their online presence to life and develop a site that suited them and their
                            clients.
                            This site was built at the beginning stages of both of our entrepenerual journeys so it is
                            in the midst of getting a much needed makeover! However through this journey I have
                            undergone a lot of growth working with clients and designing websites.

                            parking limited or unavailable. This app was created with the purpose of helping any student

                            students in effectively navigating campus. This app is aimed at new students as well as
                            students with disabilities such as autism. In doing so the application focuses on
                            highlighting important and specific features of various buildings on campus. With a more
                            visual map of campus containing important and relevant information of the buildings, this
                            app will be able to help those who need it effectively and effectively navigate campus. With
                            my role
                            being team lead, this project helped me learn how to effectively motivate and keep
                            a team on track. I was in charge of holding weekly AGILE meetings, as well as the design and
                            execution of both the paper and high fidelity protototypes.

                            <b>Overview:</b> Whack-A-Jackson is a Whack-A-Mole inspired game developed using Augmented
                            Reality. This application was created by a small group of four, over a month-long period
                            using Unity. This was our teams' first experience with Augmented Reality before, so creating
                            this application was a great learning experience for the team. As team lead I was in charge
                            of holding weekly SCRUM meetings, creating paper prototypes and designing the main menu, 
                            developed various C# scripts for the main menu buttons, timer, and score counter, etc.
