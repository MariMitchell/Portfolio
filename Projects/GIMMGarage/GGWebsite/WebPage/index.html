                <h3>Parking Location</h3>
                <p>The parking location feature aids in finding the perfect parking spot relative to your
                    personal needs. Whether you need a spot by a specific building, in a certain lot, or even
                    access to handicap accessible parking, this feature locates and leads you directly to
                    the perfect parking spot.

                <h3>Spot Tracking</h3>
                <p>The spot tracking feature keeps record of where you park your car. This way
                    you will always be able to locate where you have parked among the sea
                    of traffic.
                </p>
                <h3>Events</h3>
                <p>The events feature keeps record of events occuring at Boise State University, notifying the user
                    of potential parking issues in certain lots. If an event requires you to park in a certain lot,
                    this feature will let you know!
                </p>
                <h3>Parking Price</h3>
                <p>The parking price feature tells the user a number of details related to parking fees. It stores
                    the users current fees they owe, as well as shows how much parking costs dependent on the lot,
                    events, and day.
