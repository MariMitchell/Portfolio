                    <p>
                        WELCOME! My name is Kalyn Mitchell and I am a current student at Boise State University pursuing
                        a
                        Bachelor's in Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technologies. I have spent my time at
                        University
                        cultivating
                        a variety of skills, including gaining experience in website development, application
                        development,
                        and
                        UX/UI. These skills can be seen in a multitude of my projects throughout my portfolio.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As I have ventured down this path, I have developed a love for helping those in need of my
                        services.
                        I have created applications aimed to help the greater good, and strive to continue to do so
                        throughout my professional carreer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My want to help others can be seen throughout many of my projects. My most recent project
                        completed
                        was a prototype of an application aimed to help the students at Boise State University find
                        available parking. One of my current projects is a virtual reality game that helps dog owners,
                        specifically owners of reactive dogs, learn how to properly read their body language and gain
                        confidence in their training.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With a passion for web development and UX design, I aim to
                        create innovative and positive digital
                        experiences.

                                <b>Overview:</b> At the start of my web development journey, I had the
                                privledge working with a local martial arts school. This project
                                was more than simply developing a website, but capturing the
                                company's spirit and transforming it onto a digital space. Completing
                                this project gave me first hand experience with real world clients and
                                gave me the knowledge of how to interact in a professional manner,
                                utilize client feedback, and further strengthened my development skills
                                learned while in University.

                                <b>Overview:</b> Shortly after developing the website for Dragon Fire Martial Arts,
                                their parent company, Soul Self Defense approached me asking to help redesign
                                the Soul Self Defense Website. The development of this website helped me
                                further my skills interacting with clients. With this project I was able to hone my
                                skills,
                                embrace in client collaboration, and create a digital environment that complimented

                                <b>Overview:</b> This website was developed for a local dog training company. Our goal
                                was to bring their online presence to life and develop a site that suited them and their
                                clients.
                                This site was built at the beginning stages of both of our entrepenerual journeys so it
                                is
                                in the midst of getting a much needed makeover! However through this journey I have
                                undergone a lot of growth working with clients and designing websites.

                                students with disabilities such as autism. In doing so the application focuses on
                                highlighting important and specific features of various buildings on campus. With a more
                                visual map of campus containing important and relevant information of the buildings,
                                this

                                being team lead, this project helped me learn how to effectively motivate and keep
                                a team on track. I was in charge of holding weekly AGILE meetings, as well as the design

                                <b>Overview:</b> Whack-A-Jackson is a Whack-A-Mole inspired game developed using
                                Augmented
                                Reality. This application was created by a small group of four, over a month-long period
                                using Unity. This was our teams' first experience with Augmented Reality before, so
                                creating
                                this application was a great learning experience for the team. As team lead I was in

                                of holding weekly SCRUM meetings, creating paper prototypes and designing the main menu,
                                developed various C# scripts for the main menu buttons, timer, and score counter, etc.

                                <b>Overview:</b> Trapped is a backrooms maze Co-op. Player one and
                                player two work together to avoid AI enemies and shoot all of the targets.
                                Player one is able to control the main character and run around the maze itself,
                                while player two looks from above and is able to shut the various doors placed
                                within the maze to help player one stay safe and eliminate all targets. This game
                                was developed by a small team of students over the course of the semester. This
                                game was also my first introduction to the Unreal game engine and
                                I was able to learn how to work AI as well as blueprints.

                                <b>Overview:</b> This project was built by me and a team of students. The parameters of
                                our project was that it had to be based off of an old arcade game, it had to be
                                Multiplayer,
                                and it had to be accessible in some way. For this project we based the accessibility
                                part from two people near and dear to me. My partner and my grandfather. Both my partner
                                and grandfather have limited mobility in one or both of their hands, making traditional
                                game controllers difficult for them to grip correctly. Using Arduino technologies, my
                                team
                                developed a button system
                                that allowed players to control their tron bikes by utilizing these large buttons in
                                order
                                to steer. This project helped me realize that a lot of the times, development should
                                be done by looking outside of myself and my own needs and really take the time to
                                research
                                and converse with others in order to develop an application that can be appreciated by
                                all!

                            <p>
                                <b>Overview:</b> Poshmark is an existing application I was tasked to redesign. It is a
                                mobile application where users can either sell clothing they no longer wear or buy
                                clothing
                                at discounted prices. The appeal of this application is users can buy high end brands,
                                such
                                as Zara and Madewell, at steep discounts. Along with this, sellers can earn some
                                supplemental income from selling what they have in their closets. Based on Poshmark’s
                                designated function, to buy and sell used clothing, I asked five different people to do
                                two
                                tasks. The first is to find three items they would like to own, and act as if they were
                                going to buy them. The second is to take an article of clothing in their closet and put
                                it
                                up for sale. Based off of their experiences I came up with the following flaws and plan
                                on
                                how to fix them.

                            <p>
                                <b>Flaws and Fixes:</b> Below is a list of the seven factors that define user experience
                                and
                                my thoughts on how the app portrayed them:
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Useful: </b>There are a multitude of apps out there similar to this one, and a
                                    lack
                                    of usability could cause this app to get lost among all the others.</li>
                                <li><b>Useable: </b>Somewhat usable. It can be difficult to specify what a user is
                                    looking
                                    for, as well as navigate other features, which could cause them to turn away from
                                    the
                                    app.</li>
                                <li><b>Findable: </b>This goes alongside usability. It can be troublesome to navigate
                                    through the app to find what you are looking for.</li>
                                <li><b>Credible: </b>There is a lack of credibility in this app, considering anyone can
                                    post
                                    what they please without restrictions.</li>
                                <li><b>Desireable</b>I would say this app, as well as apps like this, are desirable as
                                    more
                                    people are leaning towards thrifting rather than supporting the fast fashion
                                    industry.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Accessible: </b>I am uncertain how accessible this app is. I couldn’t find any
                                    settings
                                    to make it easier for people with disabilities to be able to navigate.</li>
                                <li><b>Valuable: </b>The premise of the app is valuable. However, like I said with
                                    usability, there are many other apps that can provide the same service that have
                                    better
                                    design.</li>
                            </ol>
                            As for aspects of information architecture this app contains, I found Poshmark lacking in
                            both
                            navigation and organization. I found the app as a whole difficult to navigate. I also found
                            labelling to be off, redundancies in the app, and a lack of functional grouping. Moving
                            forward
                            I had two goals:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Improve navigation</li>
                                <li>Declutter and remove redundancies</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                <li>Post an item to sell</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            After conducting the interviews I came up with the following changes to the prototype:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Proceed to checkout button needs to be more prominent and stand out to the user.
                                </li>
                                <li>Add payment options at checkout.</li>
                                <li>Add continue shopping button on add to cart page.</li>
                                <li>Add a way to customize search criteria.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            Testing Round Two - The second round of user testing had the same goals as the previous
                            round.
                            In this redesign, I addressed the main issues the previous users brought forward, and no new
                            issues were brought to my attention. I felt I had developed a solid redesign at this point
                            based
                            on the positive feedback from the users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Takeaway: </b> After completing my research, I came to two conclusions. First of all,
                                the
                                design process doesn't end after development is completed. Even the most well known apps
                                can
                                benefit from continued improvment. It is important to continue to listen to the
                                application's users to create a more positive experience. Secondly, evolving the app
                                around
                                the user will aid in a more appealing application.

                                <b>Overview:</b> The above is my journey map representing a users process for finding
                                a job trainer. It represents the end-to-end experience a user has when interacting
                                with a service, in this case, dog training. The main purpose of this journey map was
                                to identify touchpoints, emotions, pain points, and areas for improvement as the user
                                goes
                                through their journey.

                                <b>Overview:</b> My empathy diagram revolves around a user experience in finding a dog
                                training. This visual tool and is used to understand and empathize with the user.
                                It provides a structured way for designers to capture and organize
                                the users' thoughts, feelings, needs, and behaviors. My overall goal is to
                                develop a deep understanding of the users' perspective in order to better
                                imform the design process.

                                my users in their natural environments in everyday situations. My goalwas to
                                understand how dog trainers utilized with different techniques and methodologies
                                with their training naturally, rather than conducting an interview. The natural
                                environment and unobtrusive observations lead to a lot of insight on the profession
                                as a whole.
